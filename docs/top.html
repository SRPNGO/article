<p>
In a recent global survey, researchers asked thousands of people a seemingly simple question: “Which number is your favorite?” The results, however, turned out to be anything but simple.
</p>
<p>
Unexpectedly, the most popular number was not one, but two. Analysts explained that people might feel “two” suggests companionship, while “one” feels lonely. Close behind, in second place, was five, often associated with the five senses and the idea of completeness.
</p>
<p>
The third spot was taken by seven. This did not surprise experts, since seven is linked to many traditions: seven days in a week, seven wonders of the world, and so on. What did puzzle them was that number three itself only reached fourth place.
</p>
<p>
Number one, the symbol of being first, was pushed down to the fifth position. Even more strangely, number four, which many cultures either love or dislike, landed in sixth place. Then came number eight, sitting firmly in seventh place, leaving some to wonder whether the “lucky eight” was not as lucky as it seemed.
</p>
<p>
Zero, often regarded as the foundation of mathematics, surprisingly ended up in eighth place. Number six, with its frequent appearance in games and daily life, could only manage ninth. Finally, nine, once thought to be a “perfect” number, found itself in tenth place.
</p>
<p>
The outcome of this ranking left many readers scratching their heads. After all, how could numbers, which are supposed to be logical, arrange themselves in such an illogical order? Yet perhaps that is the very charm of the survey: numbers may look certain on paper, but in people’s hearts, their value is far less predictable.
