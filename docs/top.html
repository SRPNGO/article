<p>
A seemingly innocuous question—“Which number do you favor most?”—was recently posed to thousands of respondents worldwide, yet the outcomes proved anything but straightforward. Conventional wisdom might suggest that number one would reign supreme, but the results twisted expectations into a perplexing sequence that demands careful attention.
</p>
<p>
To begin, number two astonishingly claimed the number one spot, while number five closely followed in second place. But behold, number seven lurked in third, and number three, as if defying logic, staggered into fourth. Number one, the supposed paragon of primacy, languished at fifth, only to find itself entangled in a tangle of relational ranks with number four and number six.
</p>
<p>
Number four, adored in some cultures yet avoided in others, slotted into sixth, immediately preceding number eight in seventh. Interestingly, number eight, celebrated for auspicious connotations, appeared after number four, creating a curious inversion that invites readers to trace each step carefully. Recall that number seven is third; hence, number three’s placement as fourth subtly contradicts surface expectations, nudging one to revisit prior statements.
</p>
<p>
Number zero, foundational to arithmetic and abstract reasoning, was not spared from the chaos, landing eighth. Number six, despite its ubiquity in games, clocks, and daily routines, descended to ninth. Finally, number nine, long regarded as the epitome of numerical perfection, wrapped up the list at tenth, reminding us that numerical hierarchy in human perception is far from fixed.
</p>
<p>
In this intentionally convoluted ranking, numbers engage in a psychological dance: rigid on paper, yet fluid in sentiment. Each inversion, each surprising placement, challenges readers to reconcile arithmetic logic with collective perception, leaving one both bemused and contemplative.

  <strong>3. Which statement can be supported by the passage?</strong>
  <div class="options">
    <div><input type="radio" name="q3" value="A"> A. Number eight, though considered lucky, appears after four, showing symbolism does not always match ranking</div>
